# SwapRun

> Dodge the hazards.
> Anticipate the swaps.
> Keep up the speed.


Move along three tracks and dodge incoming projectiles. You can only travel through a hazard when they're the same color as you.
Your color will swap with a audio queue, one to warn you and another one exactly 1 second later. 

Try and predict what color you will be when you hit the projctiles and survive as long as possible!
